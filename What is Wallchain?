Quacks and Rewards: Users earn "Quacks" through smart interactions like replies and content creation, which can lead to allocations from project token supplies (e.g., 0.25% for HeyElsaAI or Limitless). 

Integrations: Collaborations with protocols like Genome Protocol turn engagement into ownership of tokens like $NOME, creating a flywheel for sustainable growth. 

The platform also extends to tools like MEV redistribution, where users capture profits from transactions and share them with DEXs and protocols, enhancing wallet utility across chains.
